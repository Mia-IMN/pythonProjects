This is one of favourite python projects so far.

1. art.py contains code for different patterns(art) like
       a. A pattern of triangle, square, hexagon, heptagon, nonagon, decagon
       b. a spirograph
       c. An art work using the principle of random walk
   
2. turtleGame.py contains code for a drawing board that listens to user input and draws shapes accordingly

3. turtleRace.py is a game of 6 turtles racing. User bet on a color that they think would win

4. table_example.py is just me trying to see how importing from external libriaries in PyCharm work
